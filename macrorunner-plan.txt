TODO:
- Add features
	- some way to interact with any currently open file, and to write more files
		- eh I cant be bothered. More projects to do, and this extension was mainly just so that I could quickly run some hacky script on a file I have open that I will never use again. Particularly, stuff like feeding an array of [string, string] to search and replace that takes a while manually
			- allow importing of modules with require, and allow some way to know the project directory so people can do this themselves if they really need to

	-* Mitigate stack-overflows

	- save behaviour needs to switch to the saved version of the file
	
	- Create as few new API methods as needed
		
			
	
	- rename batchInsert back to insert, and add type checking to overload behaviour
		- I dont know how to do this and please the type checker. going to just rename batchX methods to XMany for now

- unit tests to write:


- do manual tests, create folder for all examples (we cant unit test these easily)
	-* setTimeout error handling


- Low priority backlog - Any pull requesters ?:
	- matchPrev (actually harder than I thought to make it efficient.)	
	- mitigate infinite loops (yes this happened)
		- Investigate javascript new thread + pthread_kill
	- detect keyboard input
	- do keyboard input
