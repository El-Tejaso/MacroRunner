TODO:
- Add features
	- write documentation
		- ctx
			- EditableFile
		- debug
		- timerContainer
		-> improve docs
		
	-> files.walk(dir)


	-* Mitigate stack-overflows

	- save behaviour needs to switch to the saved version of the file
	
	- Create as few new API methods as needed
		- matchNext
			-* matchPrev (actually harder than I thought to make it efficient.)	
	
	- rename batchInsert back to insert, and add type checking to overload behaviour
		- aaaa I dont know how to do this and please the type checker. going to just rename batchX methods to XMany for now

- unit tests to write:

- Rename macrorunner to ScriptRunner, as this makes more sense. This extension is running scripts on text, not executing keypress macros
	- but there are a lot of other extensions called ScriptRunner. rename back to macroRunner
	

- do manual tests, create folder for all examples (we cant unit test these easily)
	-* setTimeout error handling


- Low priority backlog:
	- mitigate infinite loops (yes this happened)
		-* Investigate javascript new thread + pthread_kill
			( any PRers ? )
	-* detect keyboard input ( any PRers? )
	-* do keyboard input (any PRers? )
