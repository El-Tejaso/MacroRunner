TODO:
-> Add features
	-> write documentation
	
	- Create as few new API methods as needed
		- matchNext
			-* matchPrev (actually harder than I thought to make it efficient.)	
	
	- rename batchInsert back to insert, and add type checking to overload behaviour
		- aaaa I dont know how to do this and please the type checker. going to just rename batchX methods to XMany for now

- unit tests to write:
	

-> do manual tests, create folder for all examples (we cant unit test these easily)
	-* setTimeout error handling



Bug tracker
